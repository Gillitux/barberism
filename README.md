Barberism

Individuals with Autism or sensory sensitivities often have individualized needs when it comes to getting a haircut, and finding a barbershop or barber to meet these needs may be a difficult task. This often leads to avoidance of this task altogether, resulting in looking unkempt or overgrown.

Barberism is an app where these people can connect with barbers who are willing and capable to meet these individualized needs.

No more cold calling or trial and error. Barberism starts the conversation to create the perfect match.

On the app, barbers can register as "specialists" and make a profile based on services provided.

People seeking services have the option to create a profile, browse barbers, and can contact them using a standardized request form to communicate their specific needs.

1. Users will visit the page
